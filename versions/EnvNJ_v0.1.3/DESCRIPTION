Description: Contains utilities for the analysis of protein sequences in a phylogenetic context. 
    Allows   the generation of phylogenetic trees base on protein sequences in an alignment-independent way. 
    Two different methods have been implemented. One approach is based on the frequency analysis of n-grams, 
    previously described in Stuart et al. (2002) <doi:10.1093/bioinformatics/18.1.100>. The other approach is based on the species-specific neighborhood preference around amino acids. Features include the conversion of a protein set into a vector 
    reflecting these neighborhood preferences, pairwise distances (dissimilarity) between these vectors, 
    and the generation of trees based on these distance matrices.
